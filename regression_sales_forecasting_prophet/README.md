# 🔮 Prophet-Based Sales Forecasting Project

This project utilizes **Facebook Prophet**, a powerful time series forecasting model, to **predict weekly retail sales** based on historical patterns and trends. Designed for simplicity and scalability, the model integrates into a **Streamlit app** for interactive forecasting and visualization.

---

## 📌 Business Use Case

Retailers require accurate sales forecasting for:
- 📦 Efficient inventory management
- 💰 Strategic revenue planning
- 📅 Aligning marketing and promotional campaigns

By leveraging **seasonality**, **trend analysis**, and **historical sales behavior**, this project provides a time-aware forecast of weekly retail sales using **Facebook Prophet**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> Build a time series forecasting model that can learn from historical weekly sales data and predict future sales using Prophet.

The dataset includes:
- Weekly sales figures
- Promotion indicators
- Store-level information

We aggregate the data at the **weekly level** and use Prophet to model trends, seasonality, and changepoints in the sales trajectory.
